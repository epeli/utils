# Epeli's Javascript / Typescript utilities

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/epeli/utils.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)


Some utility functions I use across multiple projects that
are not available in any defacto utility libraries like lodash.
Very Typescript heavy.

Install

    npm install @epeli/utils
